# Playing With Fire

*Programatically-controlled Propane-based Flame Effects*

The goal of this project is to increase the number of flame effects in the festival circuit. We'd like to make flame effects as easy to work with as LEDs, both for personal decoration and large scale art.

This repository documents the *process* as well as the *results* of my exploration, thus is contains plenty of work product produced along the way. Things like hand-sketched circuit diagrams, code snippets, and experiments.

## Disclaimer: Thar be dragons ahead laddy!

This repository contains **experimental, lightly-tested, research-level designs** to build **things that make giant fireballs**. These are **dangerous prototypes**. You can hurt people, damage property, and break the law. Please be careful, work under the guidance of professionals, and find a venue that supports this work (Burning Man, The Crucible, etc.). And as always, you're responsible for anything you get up to!

## Overview

This project documents my experiments with building Burning Man-style flame effects. It contains designs for several fire poofers (devices that shoot fireballs) and the FireControl2000. The latter is an arduino shield and enclosure for controlling solenoids on fire poofers.

 I've categorized things into three areas:

- [mechanics](/mechanics/README.md) contains the fire poofer propane plumbing designs
- [electronics](/electronics/README.md) contains the FirePoofer2000 arduino shield design and ancillary user interaction hardware.
- [code](/code/README.md) contains the source code for the FirePoofer2000.
