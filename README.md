# PlayingWithFire

*Programatically-controlled Propane-based Flame Effects*

## Thar be dragons ahead laddy!

This repository contains **experimental, lightly-tested, research-level designs** to build **things that make giant fireballs**. These are **dangerous prototypes**. You can hurt people, damage property, and break the law if you use these ideas improperly. Please be careful, work under the guidance of professionals, and find a venue that supports this work (Burning Man, The Crucible, etc.).
