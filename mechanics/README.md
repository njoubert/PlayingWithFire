## General Information on Propane Flame Effects



### Propane Plumbing Pro-Tips

- Black piping is cheap and works well. Galvanized piping is not allowed. Brass is great but expensive.
- Schedule 80 pipe and Class 300 or Class 3000 fittings for tank-pressure (pre-regulator) section.
- Yellow LP-compatible ("Gas Line") Sealant Tape
- NPT pipe thickness has a nominal and actual diameter that's not the same. 3/4" pipe measures closer to 1".
- Use a single ball valve on flame effect as emergency fuel supply shutoff valve.  
- Use solenoids with VITON seals (type of material).
- Leak test using soapy water.
- Union couplings make for easy assembly/disassembly.
